# BDM Capstone IITM - Newspaper Distribution Optimization

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains the **Capstone Project for the IIT Madras BDM (Business Data Management) course**.  
The project is titled:  
**“Data-Driven Optimization of Newspaper Distribution and Customer Retention Strategies in the Unorganized B2C Sector.”**

It focuses on transforming the operations of **S.K. Newspaper Mart**, a local B2C newspaper distribution service in Chennai, run by Mr. Kumar for over 23 years. The business faced challenges such as:
- Inefficient delivery routes (leading to high fuel costs and time delays),
- Unpredictable demand (causing overstocking/shortages),
- Customer churn due to lack of tracking.

## 📊 Datasets
- **Customer Master Data** *(not shared due to privacy)*  
- **Daily Delivery Logs** *(not shared due to privacy)*  
- **Route & Fuel Logs** *(uploaded in this repo )*  

⚠️ Note: Only the **Route & Fuel Logs** are included here. Other datasets contain sensitive customer information and are therefore excluded.

---

## 🛠️ Methodologies
- **Descriptive Analytics (Trend Analysis)** – Heatmaps, boxplots for demand & missed deliveries.  
- **Time Series Forecasting** – Prophet model to predict demand fluctuations.  
- **Route Optimization** – TSP with OpenRouteService API to minimize travel distance & fuel cost.  
- **Customer Churn Prediction** – Random Forest Classifier to identify at-risk customers.

---

## 📈 Key Findings
- Route optimization reduced delivery distance by ~18%, cutting fuel usage and costs.  
- Forecasting identified weekend demand spikes → better inventory planning.  
- Churn prediction showed that **delivery consistency** and **subscription length** are the most important churn factors.  

---

## ✅ Recommendations
- Adopt optimized delivery loops → lower fuel & time cost.  
- Use demand forecasts to avoid shortages/overstock.  
- Proactively monitor missed deliveries to reduce churn.  
- Digitize logs to improve tracking & efficiency.

## 🚀 Impact
This project demonstrates how **data-driven methods** can optimize traditional small businesses.  
By applying analytics, Mr. Kumar’s newspaper service reduces costs, improves customer satisfaction, and sustains profitability in the digital era.
